```html
  <div class="header">
  <h1>GetTheBasics</h1>
  <h3>Get the most done with the least code.</h3>
</div>
  ```
  
```
This is the general buttons. Round, and they change to the size of text. Standerd is light blue, good = green, warning = yellow, bad = ownage, danger = red. 
```

    <button class="btn-gtb good">good</button>
    <button class="btn-gtb warning">warning</button>
    <button class="btn-gtb bad">bad</button>
    <button class="btn-gtb danger">danger</button>

        <table>
          <h1>qlwke</h1>
          <tr>
            <td>Jill</td>
             <td>Smith</td>
            <td>50</td>
           </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Eve</td>
             <td>Jackson</td>
            <td>94</td>
           </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
```

That would add a gray background with the text off the left a little bit. and h2 - h6 is added off the h1.

```css
.mover{
  margin-left: 8px;
}```
If you add a div class called mover, it will move it auto 8px.
