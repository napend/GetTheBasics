#How to use

There are many different ways you can use this. Here are some examples.

```html
<div class="container"> </div>
```
That is just basics with fonts and others

```html
  <div class="header">
  <h1>GetTheBasics</h1>
  <h3>Get the most done with the least code.</h3>
</div>
```
That would add a gray background with the text off the left a little bit. and h2 - h6 is added off the h1.

```css
.mover{
  margin-left: 8px;
}```
If you add a div class called mover, it will move it auto 8px.
Put you can change it to what you would like in your stylesheet.
