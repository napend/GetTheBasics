#How to use

There are many different ways you can use this. Here are some examples.

Must add this.
```html
<div class="container"> </div>
```

This would add a gray background with the text off the left a little bit. and h2 - h6 is added off the h1.
```html
  <div class="header">
  <h1>GetTheBasics</h1>
  <h3>Get the most done with the least code.</h3>
  ```
</div>

This is the general buttons. Round, and they change to the size of text. Standerd is light blue, good = green, warning = yellow, bad = ownage, danger = red. 
```html
    <button class="btn-gtb standard">standard</button>
    <button class="btn-gtb good">good</button>
    <button class="btn-gtb warning">warning</button>
    <button class="btn-gtb bad">bad</button>
    <button class="btn-gtb danger">danger</button>
```
    
    These are the square buttons. Same as general with colors and text sizing.

    <button class="btn-flt standard">standard</button>
    <button class="btn-flt good">good</button>
    <button class="btn-flt warning">warning</button>
